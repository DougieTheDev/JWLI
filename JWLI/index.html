            <h2>Our History</h2>
            <p class="p-history">The Japanese Women’s Leadership Initiative (JWLI) was founded in 2006 by three
                visionary women in Boston,
                Massachusetts: Atsuko Toko Fish, Mary Lassen, and Catherine Crone Coburn. JWLI brings emerging women
                leaders, referred to as the Fellows, from Japan to Boston to receive four weeks of hands-on experience
                and
                training with successful nonprofit organizations in nonprofit management and leadership development.
                During
                their stay in Boston, the Fellows will develop an Action Plan, which will serve as a step-by-step
                roadmap to
                make their dreams of social change a reality. After returning to Japan, the Fellows are expected to make
                a
                difference in their communities based on their Action Plans. The purpose of this program is for the
                fellows
                to share the knowledge and experience they acquired in Boston with other women and social sector leaders
                within Japan.
                The Fish Family Foundation, operating in conjunction with other Boston-based nonprofit organizations, is
                administering JWLI in partnership with Simmons College School of Management’s Center for Gender in
                Organizations.In 2010, thanks to the generous funding provided by the U.S. – Japan Foundation, JWLI
                expanded its vision to hold public forums within Japan. Held in 2010, 2012 and 2013, these public forums
                provided information about the nonprofit sector and the American approach to philanthropy with hopes to
                inspire women to take leadership roles. The Forum Program reached hundreds of Japanese citizens,
                advocating for their involvement in addressing the needs of Japanese society.</p>

                various social innovative movements as a philanthropist. She is also a trustee of the Fish Family
                Foundation. In the wake of 3.11, Atsuko established the Japanese Disaster Relief Fund – Boston
                (JDRFB)
                with The Boston Foundation (TBF) and the Japan Society Boston (JSB) to support immediate and
                mid-term
                recovery in the affected regions of Tohoku. Atsuko visited Tohoku several times after the disaster
                to
                assessed and evaluated the needs of the people and community. In the two years the fund was active
                for,
                JDRFB raised approximately $1 million and distributed 24 grants to 19 organizations and projects
                working
                directly in Tohoku. It has been reported by the grantees that JDRFB’s $1 million grants were
                leveraged
                to have $6 million of economic impact.</p>
